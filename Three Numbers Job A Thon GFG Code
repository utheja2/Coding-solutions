You are given three integers A, B, and C. You are allowed to perform the following operation any number of times(possibly zero).

â€¢ Choose any integer X such that X <= max(A, B, C) , and replace A with A^X, B with B^X, and C with C ^ ^ X .

Here denote Bitwise XOR operation. Find the maximum possible value of A + B + C

Example 1:

Input:

A = 2 , B = 3 , c = 5

Output:

14



a,b,c =map(int,input().split(" "))
x=max(a,b,c)
s=0
for i in range(x):
    a=a^i
    b=b^i
    c=c^i
    s=max(s,a+b+c)
print(s)
